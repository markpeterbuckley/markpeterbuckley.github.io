# Using Markdown

Notes for the _first_ slide! These are hidden because of the ??? before it

# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor such as Atom or Sublime.

It enables source code written with easily readable notation to be rendered in HTML. Like using 'styles' and formatting options in Excel, Word etc.

It's easy to use and you may have come across it in various places on the web or used it in Slack. Even WhatsApp uses some Markdown now.

---

# Why do we use it?

* It's quick and easy to get the hang of
* You can incorporate other styles into it through HTML and CSS
* GitHub allows you host websites for free using static website generators - and Markdown is great for that
* GOV.UK has made extensive use of Markup and the service Tech Docs is mostly written in Markdown

---

# How does it work?

You can visit [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn the ins and outs

There's a basic syntax
```js
These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document.
All Markdown applications support these elements.

# H1 headings
## H2 headings
### H3 headings

Bold
**bold text**

Italic
*italicized text*

Ordered List
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item

```

# Your turn

1. Using the user needs developed yesterday we need to turn these into stories to work on
1. Create user stories in Jira or have a play in a Markdown editor first like [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) or [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)

### Use the following user story structure:

As a <span style="background-color: #fdde7aff">space analyst</span><P>
I need to <span style="background-color: #fdde7aff">know what upcoming launches are scheduled</span><p>
So that <span style="background-color: #fdde7aff">I can take action with my existing satellites</span><p>

???

|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|Space analyst|Know about upcoming launches |I can move my satellites if necessary|
|Operator     |Register myself for a launch |I can legally launch my satellite    |

# What about this 'good' story writing?

# Great User Stories always fit the **INVEST** set of criteria by Bill Wake:

- **Independent** – they can be developed in any sequence and changes to one User Story don’t affect the others.
- **Negotiable** – it’s up for the team to decide how to implement them; there is no rigidly fixed workflow.
- **Valuable** – each User Story delivers a detached unit of value to end users.
- **Estimatable** – it’s quite easy to guess how much time the development of a User Story will take.
- **Small** – it should go through the whole cycle (designing, coding, testing) during one sprint.
- **Testable** – there should be clear acceptance criteria to check whether a User Story is implemented appropriately.

---

# Made even simpler...
 - The INVEST model is great and covers everything you need
 - What works for you and your team might be different
 - Essentially an indiivual story needs to:
  - be able to be picked up by a team member and they know what to do
  - be clear when it is complete (the success criteria have been met)
